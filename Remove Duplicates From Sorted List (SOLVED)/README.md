This problem was recently asked by Apple:
<br><br>
Given a sorted list of size <b>n</b>, with <b>m</b> unique elements (thus <b>m < n</b>), modify the list such that the first m unique elements in the list will be sorted, ignoring the rest of the list. Your solution should have a space complexity of <b>O(1)</b>. Instead of returning the list (since you are just modifying the original list), you should return what <b>m</b> is.
