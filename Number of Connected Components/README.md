This problem was recently asked by Apple:
<br><br>
Given a list of undirected edges which represents a graph, find out the number of connected components.
<br><br>
In the stater code, vertices <b>1, 2, 3, 4</b> are all connected, and <b>5, 6</b> are connected, and thus there are <b>2</b> connected components in the graph above.
