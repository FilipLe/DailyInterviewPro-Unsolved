This problem was recently asked by Google:
<br><br>
Given a string, determine if you can remove any character to create a palindrome.
<br><br>Starter Code:
```
def create_palindrome(s):
  # Fill this in.

print(create_palindrome("abcdcbea"))
# True
print(create_palindrome("abccba"))
# False
print(create_palindrome("abccaa"))
# False
```
