This problem was recently asked by Twitter:
<br><br>
Given a binary search tree (BST) and a value <u><b>s</b></u>, split the BST into 2 trees, where one tree has all values less than or equal to <u><b>s</b></u>, and the other tree has all values greater than <u><b>s</b></u> while maintaining the tree structure of the original BST. 
<br>You can assume that <u><b>s</b></u> will be one of the node's value in the BST. 
<br>Return both tree's root node as a tuple.
