# Fix Brackets
Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:
<br><br>
Given a string with only <b>(</b> and <b>)</b>, find the minimum number of characters to add or subtract to fix the string such that the brackets are balanced.
<br><br>
Example:
<br><b>Input:</b> '(()()'
<br><b>Output:</b> 1
<br><br><i>Explanation:</i>
<br>
The fixed string could either be ()() by deleting the first bracket, or (()()) by adding a bracket. These are not the only ways of fixing the string, there are many other ways by adding it in different positions!
