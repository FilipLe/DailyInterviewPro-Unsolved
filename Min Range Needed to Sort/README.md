Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Twitter:
<br>
<br>
Given a list of integers, return the bounds of the minimum range that must be sorted so that the whole list would be sorted.
<br>
<br>
Example:
<br>
Input: [1, 7, 9, 5, 7, 8, 10]
<br>
Output: (1, 5)
<br>
<br>
Explanation:
<br>
The numbers between index 1 and 5 are out of order and need to be sorted.
