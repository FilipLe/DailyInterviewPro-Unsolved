This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
<br><br>
Return the longest run of 1s for a given integer n's binary representation.
<br><br>
<b>Example:</b><br>
<i>Input: 242<br>
Output: 4</i><br><br>
242 in binary is <b>11110010</b>, so the longest run of 1 is 4.
<br><br>Starter Code:
```
def longest_run(n):
  # Fill this in.

print longest_run(242)
# 4
```
