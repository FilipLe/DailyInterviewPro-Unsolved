This problem was recently asked by Facebook:
<br><br>
Given a list of meetings that will happen during a day, find the minimum number of meeting rooms that can fit all meetings.
<br><br>
Each meeting will be represented by a tuple of <b>(start_time, end_time)</b>, where both <b>start_time</b> and <b>end_time</b> will be represented by an integer to indicate the time. start_time will be inclusive, and end_time will be exclusive, meaning a meeting of (0, 10) and (10, 20) will only require 1 meeting room.
