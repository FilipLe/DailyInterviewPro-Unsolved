This problem was recently asked by Microsoft:
<br><br>
Given a valid parenthesis string (with only <b>'('</b> and <b>')'</b>, an open parenthesis will always end with a close parenthesis, and a close parenthesis will never start first), remove the outermost layers of the parenthesis string and return the new parenthesis string.
<br><br>
If the string has multiple outer layer parenthesis (ie <b>(())()</b>), remove all outer layers and construct the new string. So in the example, the string can be broken down into <b>(()) + ()</b>. By removing both components outer layer we are left with <b>() + ''</b> which is simply <b>()</b>, thus the answer for that input would be <b>()</b>.
