The Fibonacci sequence is the integer sequence defined by the recurrence relation: F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), where F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. In other words, the nth Fibonacci number is the sum of the prior two Fibonacci numbers. Below are the first few values of the sequence:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144...
