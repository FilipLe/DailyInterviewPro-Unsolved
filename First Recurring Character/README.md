# First Recurring Character

This problem was recently asked by Amazon:
<br><br>
Given a string, return the first recurring letter that appears. If there are no recurring letters, return None.
<br><br>
```
Example:
Input: qwertty
Output:t

Input: qwerty
Output: None
```
<br><br>Starter Code:
```
def first_recurring_char(s):
  # Fill this in.
  
print(first_recurring_char('qwertty'))
# t

print(first_recurring_char('qwerty'))
# None
```
