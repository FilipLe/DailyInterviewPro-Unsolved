This problem was recently asked by Uber:
<br>
<br>
Design a simple stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.
<br>
<br>
push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
<br>
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.<br>
top() -- Get the top element.<br>
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.<br>
<br>
Note: be sure that pop() and top() handle being called on an empty stack.
