<br><br>
Pascal's Triangle is a triangle where all numbers are the sum of the two numbers above it. Here's an example of the Pascal's Triangle of size 5.
<br>
```
<br>&ensp;&ensp; &ensp; 1
<br>&ensp; &ensp;&ensp;1 1
<br> &ensp;   &ensp; 1 2 1
<br>&ensp;&ensp;1 3 3 1
<br>&ensp;1 4 6 4 1
```
<br><br>Given an integer <b>n</b>, generate the <b>n-th</b> row of the Pascal's Triangle.
