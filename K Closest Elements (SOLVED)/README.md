This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:
<br><br>
Given a list of sorted numbers, and two integers <b>k</b> and <b>x</b>, find <b>k</b> closest numbers to the pivot <b>x</b>.
<br><br>
Starter Code:
```
def closest_nums(nums, k, x):
 # Fill this in.
 
print(closest_nums([1, 3, 7, 8, 9], 3, 5))
# [7, 3, 8]
```
