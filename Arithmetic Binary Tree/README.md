Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:
<br>
<br>
You are given a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression. In this tree, each leaf is an integer value,, and a non-leaf node is one of the four operations: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
<br>
<br>
Write a function that takes this tree and evaluates the expression.
<br>
<br>
Example:

<br>
<br>
This is a representation of the expression ((5 + 9) * 2) + 3, and should return 31.
