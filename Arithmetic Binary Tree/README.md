Hi, here's your problem today. This problem was recently asked by Apple:
<br>
<br>
You are given a binary tree representation of an arithmetic expression. In this tree, each leaf is an integer value,, and a non-leaf node is one of the four operations: '+', '-', '*', or '/'.
<br>
<br>
Write a function that takes this tree and evaluates the expression.
<br>
Example:

    *
   / \
  +    +
 / \  / \
3  2  4  5
<br>
<br>
This is a representation of the expression (3 + 2) * (4 + 5), and should return 45.
