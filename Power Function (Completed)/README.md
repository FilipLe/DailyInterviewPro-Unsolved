This problem was recently asked by AirBNB:
<br><br>
The power function calculates x raised to the nth power. 
<br>
<br>If implemented in <b>O(n)</b> it would simply be a for loop over n and multiply x n times. 
<br><br>Instead implement this power function in <b>O(log n)</b> time. You can assume that n will be a non-negative integer.
