This problem was recently asked by Facebook:
<br><br>
Given a numerator and a denominator, find what the equivalent decimal representation is as a string. If the decimal representation has recurring digits, then put those digits in brackets (ie <b>4/3</b> should be represented by <b>1.(3)</b> to represent 1.333...). Do not use any built in evaluator functions like python's <b>eval</b>. You can also assume that the denominator will be nonzero.
<br><br>Starter Code:
```
def frac_to_dec(numerator, denominator):
  # Fill this in.

print(frac_to_dec(-3, 2))
# -1.5

print(frac_to_dec(4, 3))
# 1.(3)

print(frac_to_dec(1, 6))
# 0.1(6)
```
