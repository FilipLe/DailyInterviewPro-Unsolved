This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:
<br><br>
Given a string, convert it to an integer without using the builtin <b>str</b> function. You are allowed to use <b>ord</b> to convert a character to ASCII code.
<br><br>
Consider all possible cases of an integer. In the case where the string is not a valid integer, return <b>None</b>.
