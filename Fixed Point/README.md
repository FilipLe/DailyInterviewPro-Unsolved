This problem was recently asked by Apple:
<br><br>
A fixed point in a list is where the value is equal to its index. 
<br>So for example the list [-5, 1, 3, 4]: 
<br>&ensp;<b>1</b> is a fixed point in the list since the index and value is the same. 
<br>Find a fixed point (there can be many, just return 1) in a <b>sorted list of distinct elements</b>, or return <b>None</b> if it doesn't exist.
