# Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
<br>Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e.,  ```[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]``` might become  ```[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]```).

Find the minimum element.

The array may contain duplicates.

<b>Example 1:</b>
```
Input: [1,3,5]
Output: 1
```
<b>Example 2:</b>
```
Input: [2,2,2,0,1]
Output: 0
```
